# Vahana-KAI
Just a small project to remake my RC Car.  Try to switch the development tools from [Python(hardware control) + Node.js(UI)] to pure Node.js with C library for faster reaction.

ToDo List:
* ~~New ENV & New package Test~~
* Engine Test
* Camera upgrade
* Road test Phase_1
* Control UI renew
* Road test Phase_2
