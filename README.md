# Vahana-KAI
Just a small project to remake my RC Car.  Try to switch the development tools from [Python(hardware control) + Node.js(UI)] to pure Node.js with C library for faster reaction.

ToDo List:
* ~~New ENV & New package Test~~
* ~~Engine Test (TAMIYA motor Orange v2)~~
* ~~Camera program upgrade~~ live view trans speedup
* ~~Road test Phase_1~~
* Control UI renew -> NEXT TODO with new feature
* Road test Phase_2
